Implementation and Methodology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TODO: 

Writing the methodology lies at the core of the paper, and fulfills one of the basic principles underlying the scientific method. Any scientific paper needs to be verifiable by other researchers, so that they can review the results by replicating the experiment and guaranteeing the validity. To assist this, you need to give a completely accurate description of the equipment and the techniques used for gathering the data []_.

Other scientists are not going to take your word for it, and they want to be able to evaluate whether your methodology is sound. In addition, it is useful for the reader to understand how you obtained your data, because it allows them to evaluate the quality of the results. For example, if you were trying to obtain data about shopping preferences, you will obtain different results from a multiple-choice questionnaire than from a series of open interviews. Writing methodology allows the reader to make their own decision about the validity of the data. If the research about shopping preferences were built upon a single case study, it would have little external validity, and the reader would treat the results with the contempt that they deserve []_.

Describe the materials and equipment used in the research. Explain how the samples were gathered, any randomization techniques and how the samples were prepared. Explain how the measurements were made and what calculations were performed upon the raw data. Describe the statistical techniques used upon the data []_.
